This data comes from the Global Historical Climatology Network, and is the actual raw data provided by NOAA. The only changes I have made to this data are a few small formatting changes to help meet the learning goals of this exercise. \n",

When entering column specifications, remember that normal people count from 1 and include end points, while Python counts from 0 and doesn't include end points (so if the readme says data is in columns 10-20, in Python that'd be 9 through 20)."

Given that, the larger you can make your chunks the better, so long as your chunks don't use up all your RAM.
